# TranslateTheWord
Android application language game

This game is about guessing the translation of a word. You get 4 alternatives
and if the translation is right you will recieve points that later can be shared to Facebook. 
If You answer wrong the round is finished and you can see your final score. 

We are using thesHub which is a multilanguage API that works like a big vocabulary.
With this API we can fast get words, translate them and identify language. Or like we did build a game.

We use the API to get a random word in swedish and the translation of the word in english.
We also get 3 other random words in english to be showen in the alternative list.
